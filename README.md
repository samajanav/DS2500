Repository of work from DS2500 - Intermediate Programming with Data

**1. PSLF Borrower Balance Analysis:**  
This project visualizes PSLF borrower balances. A line chart compares average balances in Connecticut and Delaware over time, while a histogram shows the distribution of balances in November, with most around 60,000 to 65,000.

**2. Marathon Finish Time and Age Analysis:**  
This project examines trends in marathon finish times and runner age from 2010 to 2023. A line chart shows changes in average finish time and median age, while a regression plot reveals a downward trend in mean finish times, suggesting improving performance over time.

**3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Optimization:**  
This project evaluates the optimal k value for a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model by comparing accuracy, precision, and recall scores across different k values. The results show the best k for accuracy, precision, and recall, providing insights into model performance trade-offs for classification tasks.

**4. PCA and K-Means Clustering Analysis:**  
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering. PCA reduces the dataset to two components for visualization, with clusters shown in a scatterplot. An inertia plot helps determine the optimal number of clusters, highlighting the balance between cluster count and data fit.

**5. Stock Market Volatility Prediction:**  
This project aims to predict stock market volatility by comparing two approaches: the standard deviation method and the GARCH model. Using data on stock prices, unemployment rates, and interest rates, the analysis highlights how these economic factors impact stock volatility. The findings show that while the standard deviation method provides accuracy, the GARCH model offers deeper insights into volatility trends over time.
